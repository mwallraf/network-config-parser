* virtual-ring report says that vlans do not match but this is because vlans may have missing naming or description between devices, check on vlan id instead of vlan name
* add a check for inconsistent vlan names between devices
* C-VLANS are not SVI interfaces usually so they are not created as a vlan on the SDS, add the C-VLAN manually in the vlans model
* rplowner reporting is not working
* SAS87 does not know about ring east-west termination or rplowner
* virtual ring status: include warning instead of only errors
* warnings about vlan name are calculated double in some cases
!! * on 87xx the vlan+port link should be added
* generate hosts file, keep track of last seen or something .. to avoid hosts not being parsed
DONE * generate errors for ring name issues
